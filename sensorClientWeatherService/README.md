# AlertR Sensor Client Weather Service

This client is specialized to fetch data from a weather service provider (wunderground.com or open-meteo.com) and provide the AlertR system with this information.


## How to use it?

To use this client you have to configure it first. A commented configuration template file is located inside the "config" folder. A init.d example file for Debian systems is located inside the "init.d_example" folder if you want to start the client with the start of the host computer.

If you need a more detailed description of how to set up an AlertR system, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR/wiki).
